# GoBabyGo2.1

## About 

Welcome to the project Go Baby Go 2.1
This project was created as part of the Project Experience course at [VIVES University of Applied Sciences](https://www.vives.be/en).  
The main goal of this project is to create a working product out of the previous proof of concept [GoBabyGo2.0](https://github.com/vives-project-xp/GoBabyGo2.0), a conversion kit and user manual for a standard mini-car.
The overall goal is to make the mini-car accessible for childeren with limited mobility by turning the gas pedal and steeringwheel into a joystick .When the caretaker (parents/supervisor/nurse/...) needs to interfere they can by using the remote controller.

## Features

- Standalone with interference from controller
- Easy to install for user
- To give children with disabilities the ability to drive a mini car like other children without disabilities.

## How it works
 
Every mini car can be converted into a mini car with the steering and accelerator pedals changed
to a joystick. The intention is for people without a technical background or
technical knowledge, can convert the car using a manual.

## Project status 
  The prototype car is functional the user manual and kit just need to be made.
