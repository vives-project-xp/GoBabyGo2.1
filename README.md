# GoBabyGo2.1

## About 

Welcome to the project Go Baby Go 2.1
This project was created as part of the Project Experience course at [VIVES University of Applied Sciences](https://www.vives.be/en).  
The main goal of this project is to create a working product out of the previous proof of concept [GoBabyGo2.0](https://github.com/vives-project-xp/GoBabyGo2.0) and make a conversion kit and user manual for a standard mini-car.
The overall goal is to increase children with limited mobility by changing the traditional accelerator pedal and steering wheel into a joystick who can be moved by the children. When the caretaker (parents/supervisor/nurse/...) needs to interfere they can by using the remote controller. 

## The team

- [Alberiek Depreytere](https://github.com/AlberiekDepreytere)
- [Vic Verbiest]
- [Lynn Delaere]
- [Bavo Lezy]

## Features

- Standalone with interference from controller
- Easy to install for user
- Helping children with a disability to ride a mini car without too much difference to other kids in a normal mini car.

## How it works
 
 Each mini car can be converted to a car who's compatible to the needs for children with a disability.
 This can be done by following our user manual and converter kit so that a person who isnâ€™t a technician but handy can 
 install it. The brain in the car is a ESP who reads the joystick, or controller, input  and controlls the motor.

## Project status 
  The prototype car is functional the user manual and kit just need to be made.

## Documentation

 You can find the user manual in. [Yet to be made.]()
 If you want to build your own converter kit you can find all the additional info in the [Yet to be made.]()
