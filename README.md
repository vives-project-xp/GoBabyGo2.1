# GoBabyGo2.1

## About

Go Baby Go 2.1 is an innovative project that aims to enhance the mobility and independence of children with disabilities.
This project was created as part of the Project Experience course at [VIVES University of Applied Sciences](https://www.vives.be/en), in collaboration with the Ergotherapy program. This project focuses on adapting mini-cars to meet the specific needs of these children.
The main goal of this project is to create a working product out of the previous proof of concept [GoBabyGo2.0](https://github.com/vives-project-xp/GoBabyGo2.0), where the functions of the steeringweel and the gaspedal are replaced by a joystick.
By creating adaptable vehicle kits and comprehensive instructions, the project strives to empower caregivers and non-technical individuals to customize cars for children with ease.

## Features

- Assembly kit development
- Comprehensive manual
- Implementing joystick as steering
- Standalone with interference from controller

## How it works

The project focusses on developing a user-friendly assembly kit with easy to follow instructions for converting standard mini-cars into accessible vehicles for children with disabilities. The function of the steering wheel and accelerator pedals are replaced by a joystick.
The assembly kit comes with easy to follow instructions so the assembly kit can be made and added to the package of the car. Every car comes then with a conversion manual so the assembly kit can easily be installed on the car. The assembly kit is engineered with user-friendly design principles, ensuring accessibility for individuals without prior experience in electronics.

## Project status

The prototype car is functional the user manual and kit just need to be made.

## Documentation

 You can find the user manual in. [Yet to be made.]()
 If you want to build your own, then here is the converter kit[ombouwkit](/Documentation/Ombouwkit.md) here you can find all the additional info.
