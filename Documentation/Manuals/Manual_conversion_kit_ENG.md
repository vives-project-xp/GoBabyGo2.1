## Modifications

### Unpacking the car

Remove the car from the packaging, organize the contents by category and store all the items nearly to ensure nothing is lost.

Position the car so that the front is on your right side. Dispose of the packaging waste in the designated trash bin.

### Battery test

In the left side of the car, you'll find the main wiring of the vehicle.
 Inside this compartment you will find the battery, which is not yet connected.
Attached to the power socket, there is a red cable and a black cable.
Connect the red cable to the red terminal of the battery, and the black cable to the black terminal of the battery.
Test whether the battery is properly connected by turning on the car.
Disconnect the battery again after testing to ensure safe operation.

### Steering

The steering wheel does not need to be attached to the car as it will be entirely replaced by a joystick.
 The joystick will take over the functions of the accelerator pedal and the steering.
 Attach the 3D prints to the dashboard accordingly, first goes the high round piece that fits into the dashboard's notch.
 Then goes the

<!-- The steering wheel should not be attached to the car as it will be completely replaced by a joystick. The joystick will fully take over the function of both the gas pedal and the steering wheel. Attach the 3D prints to the dashboard, starting with the tall round piece, which should fit into the dashboard's indentation. <!--Loosen the screws of the cable duct and remove the cable duct from the car.
Then, locate the wires leading to the accelerator, which are usually the purple wires. Cut them as close to the accelerator as possible.
Cut 4 red wires of ...cm length and strip both ends. Solder a cable shoe to one end of each wire so they can be slid onto the joystick.
(Could these come loose due to driving shocks?)
Attach the wires to the joystick and determine which wires are for which movement: forward, backward, left, or right.
Cut 1 black wire of ...cm length and strip both ends. Solder a cable shoe to one end of the wire so it can be slid onto the joystick.
Cut 3 short wires of ...cm length and strip both ends. Solder these wires between the ground pin of the different switches on the joystick.
Which wires are switched for forward and backward movement?
Which wires are switched for left and right movement?
The ground wire is connected to?-->

### Kill-Switch

To install the kill-switch, first drill a hole in the back of the car.
 Ensure that the hole is not too close to the car's edge and is easily accessible from underneath.

<!--To install the kill-switch, you first need to drill a hole in the back of the car.
Make sure the hole is not too close to the edge of the car and is easily accessible from underneath.
Cut the ?? wire to place the kill-switch between them. Cut a red and a black wire approximately 50cm long, strip both ends of the wires.
Solder both wires to the switch, the red wire to one of the outer pins of the switch, the black wire to the middle pin.
Then solder the red wire to the ?? side of the cut wire and the black wire to the ?? side. Protect the soldered parts using heat shrink tubes.
Next, thread the wire hanging from the kill-switch through the provided cavity for the taillights.
Insert the kill-switch through the previously made hole and secure it with the supplied nut.
To test the operation of the switch, turn on the car using the on-off button. If the car does not start, there may be a poor connection somewhere in the circuit.
If the car starts, the circuit is working correctly, which can be verified by turning off the kill-switch. This will cause the car to shut down.-->

### Doors and mirrors

To install the doors, first unscrew the two screws next to the dashboard of the car.
 Then, place the door on the car and screw the two screws back through the door and the holes.
 Next, snap the mirrors onto the doors; they can only snap onto the door in one way

### Remote controle holder

Place the holder for the remote control on the back of the car. It's best to do this with a glue gun, bolt, and nut.
 There is a hole provided in the print for a bolt and nut. Insert them into the print and through the car.
 Then, glue the print in place for reinforcement. This holder is also just above the kill switch. Make sure the kill switch remains operable

### Wheels

To attach the wheels, we need the following materials: the 4 wheels, the 4 rims, and the 4 washers.
 Differentiate between the front and rear wheels; this is clearly visible in the figure.
 Turn the car upside down to make the wheels easier to mount. Place the rear wheels at the back of the car and the front wheels at the front.
 Slide the rear wheels onto the axle of the car, then insert the cotter pin into the hole of the axle.
 Bend both legs of the cotter pin in different directions with pliers for extra rigidity.

Next, we install the front wheels. First, place a washer on the axle, slide it on, and place another washer.
 The wheel should not be loose; if it is, another washer must be added.
 Insert the cotter pin into the hole of the axle and bend both legs of the cotter pin in different directions with pliers for extra rigidity.
 Attach all rims to the wheels.
