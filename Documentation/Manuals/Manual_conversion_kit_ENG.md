### Battery test

In the left side of the car, you'll find the main wiring of the vehicle. Inside this compartment you will find the battery, which is not yet connected. Attached to the power socket, there is a red cable and a black cable. Connect the red cable to the red terminal of the battery, and the black cable to the black terminal of the battery. Test whether the battery is properly connected by turning on the car. Disconnect the battery again after testing to ensure safe operation.
